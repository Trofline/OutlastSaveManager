### **❗❗❗ IMPORTANT❗❗❗**

 
> -  To install the program, make a directory named `SaveManager` in the outlast roor directory and drag and drop everything in there.
>	 Now start `OutlastSaveManager.exe` and it will create some folders & files first of, then in the outlast root directory there should be shortcuts to use
> -  SaveManager has a `RunWithOtherProgram.bat` file, which you can use to start other tools together with mine. You just need to right click, edit with editor
>  	 and change then copy&paste the path to your other tool inside of there, you will see where exactly. It will then start your selected tool, and once outlast boots up it starts Saveanager.
>	 Make sure to create a shortcut for runwithotherprogram.bat, so you dont move the batch file anywhere
> -  SaveManager will only work without Steam!
> -  Make sure to check Hotkeys in the settings, there are some useful ones and features you can only use trough hotkeys
> -  You can edit the Game-Hours by clicking on the label!
> -  You can disable these info icons in the settings
> -  Checking the Parent-Box in the TreeView (for example SaveData), checks of course the Child-Box's too
> -  If it will sometime be not visible in the taskbar, press` kombination to toggle window` or whatever you have bound it to, to bring it up again
>  	 this mostly happens when you boot it with `StartMinimized`, or press win key while its booting up
> -  To boot (if outlast is already open) just open `SaveManager`, otherwise there will be automaticaly
>  	 shortcuts in the outlast root folder created for you, where you can then start with mods directly or just vanilla...
> -  Inside of the folder `Boot`, you can put shortcuts of programs/websites/folder... in. The programm will run everything inside of there; Go to settings and open it up there
> -  Make sure to have the mod `Borderless Window Mod` in the settings enabled, to avoid tabbing out from [Toggle Window]
> -  Make sure NOT to rename ANYTHING from the SaveManager, or it might not work anymore
> -  Some of the mods you will have to re-enable after s+q (looking out for a fix in the future)
> -  If you have External Mods enabled, and booted the Manager together with another program, some mods could have a conflict with the other tool
> -  Some mods/keybinds will only work with Internal Mods, so have External Mods disabled!
> -  You can hover over almost everything to see what its doing
> -  Make keybinds for SpeedrunHelper (btw. it keeps the checkpoints after closing the game)

### Changelog

> -  This a hella big update, I tested everything I could possibly think of, but if you find any bugs please report them in the help section
> -  Most of the new features are only useable via Hotkeys.
> -  If you got more ideas, just text me on discord
